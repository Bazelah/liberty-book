                Lilly Singh isn’t just a superstar. She’s Superwoman—which is also the name of her wildly popular
                YouTube channel. Funny, smart, and insightful, the actress and comedian covers topics ranging from
                relationships to career choices to everyday annoyances. It’s no wonder she’s garnered more than a
                billion views. But Lilly didn’t get to the top by being lucky—she had to work for it. Hard.
                <br>
                Now Lilly wants to share the lessons she learned while taking the world by storm, and the tools she used
                to do it. How to Be a Bawse is the definitive guide to conquering life. Make no mistake, there are no
                shortcuts to success, personal or professional. World domination requires real effort, dedication, and
                determination. Just consider Lilly a personal trainer for your life—with fifty rules to get you in the
                game, including
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Let Go of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</strong> Temptation will try to steer you away
                        from
                        your goals. FOMO is just a test of your priorities, a test that a bawse is ready to pass.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be Nice to People:</strong> Treat niceness like an item on your daily to-do list. People
                        will go out of their way to help and support you because you make them feel good.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Schedule Inspiration:</strong> Lack of motivation isn’t permanent or a sign of weakness.
                        Expect it and proactively schedule time to be creative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be the Dumbest: </strong> Challenge yourself by surrounding yourself with people who
                        know more than you do. It’s a vital way to learn and improve.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Told in Lilly’s hilarious, bold voice and packed with photos and candid stories from her journey to the
                top, How to Be a Bawse will make you love your life and yourself—even more than you love Beyoncé. (Yes,
                we said it!)
                <br>
                <strong>WARNING:</strong> This book does not include hopeful thoughts, lucky charms, or cute quotes.
                That’s because success, happiness, and everything else you want in life need to be worked for, not
                wished for. In Lilly’s world, there are no escalators, only stairs. Get ready to climb.
                <br>
                <strong>Advance praise for How to Be a Bawse</strong>

                lessons that we are all lucky to have access to. This book is a must-have for the hustler in all of us.”
